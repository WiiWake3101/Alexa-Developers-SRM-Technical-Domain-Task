# Description:
Create a simple web application that allows users to check the weather for a specific location. You will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this app. The app should fetch weather data from a public API and display it to the user.

# Title: Build a Weather App

# Requirements:
1. User Interface:
    - Create an input field for users to enter the name of a city or a location.
    - Design a button to trigger the weather information retrieval.
    - Display the temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy), and the location name on the screen.
2. Weather Data:
    - Use the `OpenWeatherMap` API (https://openweathermap.org/api) or any other public weather API to fetch weather data.
    - Parse the API response to extract the necessary weather information.
3. Functionality:
    - When the user enters a location and clicks the button, the app should fetch and display the weather data for that location.
    - Implement error handling to display a message if the city is not found or there is an API request issue.
4. Styling:
    - Style your application using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
    - Consider using icons or images to represent the weather conditions.
5. Extra Features (Optional):
    - Add a background image that changes based on the weather conditions.
    - Include a toggle for Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.
